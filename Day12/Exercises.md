# Day12 Exercises: Encapsulation, Getters & Setters, Immutability

## Objectives
- Practice core concepts of the topic through hands-on prompts
- Strengthen problem-solving and fluency without relying on solutions

## Prompts (No code; write solutions yourself)
1. Write 3 short practice tasks directly related to the topic.
2. Create 1 mini scenario that applies the topic to a simple real-world case.
3. Draft 5–10 quick questions to self-check understanding.
4. Design 1 challenge that combines this topic with at least one previous day.
5. Reflect briefly: What was hardest? What did you learn?

## Guidance
- Prefer incremental steps and small wins before the full challenge
- Time-box each prompt (e.g., 10–20 minutes)
- Save your attempts and notes below each prompt

## Notes
- Keep examples minimal; focus on core concept fluency
- Avoid copying solutions; struggle productively first
