# Day 03 Reflection: Operators, Conditionals, Loops

## 📝 Today's Learning Summary

### What I Learned Today
- [ ] Understanding of different types of operators (arithmetic, assignment, comparison, logical, bitwise)
- [ ] Mastery of conditional statements (if, if-else, switch)
- [ ] Proficiency with loop constructs (for, while, do-while)
- [ ] Understanding of operator precedence and associativity
- [ ] Control flow statements (break, continue, return)
- [ ] Short-circuit evaluation in logical operators

### Key Concepts Mastered
1. **Operators**
   - Arithmetic: +, -, *, /, %, ++, --
   - Assignment: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=
   - Comparison: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
   - Logical: &&, ||, !, &, |, ^
   - Bitwise: &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>, >>>

2. **Conditional Statements**
   - if, if-else, if-else if-else
   - switch statement with break
   - Switch expressions (Java 14+)
   - Null safety considerations

3. **Loop Constructs**
   - for loop (traditional and enhanced)
   - while loop
   - do-while loop
   - Nested loops
   - Control statements (break, continue)

### Code Examples I Practiced
- [ ] Calculator application with menu system
- [ ] Number guessing game
- [ ] Factorial calculation with different loops
- [ ] Prime number finder
- [ ] Grade calculator using switch
- [ ] Operator demonstrations
