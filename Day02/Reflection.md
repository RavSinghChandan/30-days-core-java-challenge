# Day 02 Reflection: Variables, Data Types, Type Casting, Wrapper Classes

## 📝 Today's Learning Summary

### What I Learned Today
- [ ] Understanding of all 8 primitive data types and their memory requirements
- [ ] Variable declaration and initialization syntax
- [ ] Type casting (implicit and explicit) with data loss scenarios
- [ ] Wrapper classes and their purpose in Java
- [ ] Autoboxing and unboxing concepts
- [ ] String conversion methods and utility functions

### Key Concepts Mastered
1. **Primitive Data Types**
   - byte, short, int, long (integer types)
   - float, double (floating point types)
   - char (character type)
   - boolean (logical type)

2. **Type Casting**
   - Implicit casting (widening): smaller to larger type
   - Explicit casting (narrowing): larger to smaller type
   - Data loss in narrowing conversions

3. **Wrapper Classes**
   - Purpose: convert primitives to objects
   - Autoboxing: primitive → wrapper (automatic)
   - Unboxing: wrapper → primitive (automatic)
   - Null handling and NullPointerException risks

### Code Examples I Practiced
- [ ] Variable declarations with different data types
- [ ] Type casting demonstrations
- [ ] Wrapper class conversions
- [ ] Autoboxing and unboxing examples
- [ ] String to primitive conversions
- [ ] Temperature converter application
