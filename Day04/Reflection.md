# Day 04 Reflection: Arrays & 2D Arrays

## 📝 Today's Learning Summary

### What I Learned Today
- [ ] Understanding of array declaration and initialization methods
- [ ] Mastery of array traversal techniques (traditional for, enhanced for, while loops)
- [ ] Proficiency with 2D arrays and multidimensional arrays
- [ ] Understanding of array memory management and layout
- [ ] Implementation of common array operations (search, sort, copy)
- [ ] Working with jagged arrays and their practical applications

### Key Concepts Mastered
1. **Array Fundamentals**
   - Declaration and initialization syntax
   - Zero-based indexing and bounds checking
   - Fixed size nature and memory allocation
   - Type safety and contiguous memory storage

2. **Array Traversal**
   - Traditional for loop with index access
   - Enhanced for loop (for-each) for value iteration
   - While loop for custom iteration logic
   - Performance considerations for different traversal methods

3. **2D Arrays**
   - Declaration and initialization of rectangular arrays
   - Nested loop traversal patterns
   - Matrix operations (transpose, diagonal sum)
   - Jagged arrays for irregular data structures

4. **Array Operations**
   - Linear and binary search algorithms
   - Sorting algorithms (bubble sort, Arrays.sort())
   - Array copying methods (System.arraycopy, Arrays.copyOf, clone)
   - Utility methods from Arrays class
