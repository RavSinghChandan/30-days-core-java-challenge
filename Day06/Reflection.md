# Day 06 Reflection: OOP Basics: Class, Object, Constructor, static, this

## 📝 Today's Learning Summary

### What I Learned Today
- [ ] Understanding of Object-Oriented Programming fundamentals
- [ ] Mastery of class and object creation in Java
- [ ] Proficiency with different types of constructors
- [ ] Understanding of static members and their usage
- [ ] Mastery of the 'this' keyword and its applications
- [ ] Implementation of constructor overloading and chaining

### Key Concepts Mastered
1. **OOP Fundamentals**
   - Classes as blueprints for objects
   - Objects as instances of classes
   - Four main OOP principles (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction)
   - Memory allocation and object lifecycle

2. **Class and Object Design**
   - Class structure with attributes and methods
   - Object creation using 'new' keyword
   - Instance variables vs static variables
   - Method implementation and access

3. **Constructors**
   - Default constructors and parameterized constructors
   - Constructor overloading for flexibility
   - Constructor chaining using this()
   - Copy constructors for object duplication

4. **Static Members**
   - Static variables shared across all objects
   - Static methods accessible without object creation
   - Static blocks for initialization
   - Static vs instance member differences

5. **'this' Keyword**
   - Referring to current object instance
   - Distinguishing instance variables from parameters
   - Constructor chaining with this()
   - Method chaining for fluent APIs

### Code Examples I Practiced
- [ ] Bank Account Management System with OOP concepts
- [ ] Student class with multiple constructors
- [ ] Calculator class with static and instance methods
- [ ] Rectangle class with method chaining
- [ ] Library Management System with multiple classes
- [ ] Counter class with static tracking
