# Day 06: Reflection – Class, Object, Constructor, static, this

---

## What I Learned Today
1. Classes are **blueprints**, objects are **real-world instances**.
2. Constructors simplify initialization and reduce errors.
3. `this` keyword is crucial for resolving conflicts and chaining.
4. `static` provides shared resources, reducing memory usage.

## Real-World Analogy
- Class = **Architect’s blueprint**
- Object = **Actual house built**
- Constructor = **Builder following the plan**
- this = **Pointing to my house (not someone else’s)**
- static = **Shared electricity grid for all houses**

## Personal Reflection
- I now understand how Java ties real-world thinking into code.
- The `static` keyword was most enlightening—it saves memory and avoids duplicate copies.
- Tomorrow I’ll practice constructor overloading and static counters deeply.

✅ Day 06 complete!
